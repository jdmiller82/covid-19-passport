# Covid-19 Vaccination Passport
A very simple website to add to your mobile phone as a "passport" to show you have been vaccinated for Covid 19.

This project uses pug templates and sass for styles. There is no javascript, though a app.js file is available, should you want to add some for some reason.

This project uses codekit to compile everything into a build folder, but you should be able to use your preferred way of compiling and depolying to your server.
